#### 1. Dataset
We will work with long-read 16S and 18S amplicon dataset generated from samples taken from the Wadden Sea and Southern Ocean in this practical session. 16S amplicons were generated with the primer set A519F-1492R-pB-3771 (Martijn et.al., 2019), while the 18S amplicons were generated with the primer set Euk528F-U1391R (Edgcomb et.al. 2011).
